### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently tech lead @polarstork.

* I Advocate and daily work on Flutter and Dart as my main language, but I'm flexible to learn or work with other technologies, I'm fluent in Javascript and Go. 
* I'm mostly active on Bitbucket for my day-to-day job, Thus I don't have much activity here.
* My git/gist is essentially used for PoC projects, Review PRs, or packages for maintenance.
* I might contribute to private projects, or open sources wherever I feel like it.
> If you're looking for a code review or a consultancy service contact me on LinkedIn I'll be glad to help!


My average working hour is ~11-12 hours a day for over 5 years, this is a typical week for me.

If you end up looking at my git or gist you might find something interesting but beware it doesn't fully represent my prospect.
