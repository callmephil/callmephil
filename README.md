### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I Advocate and daily work for and with Flutter and Dart, but I'm flexible to learn or work with other languages, mainly Javascript and Go. I'm currently tech lead @polarstork.
* I'm mostly active on Bitbucket for my day-to-day job, Thus I don't have much activity here.
* My git is essentially used for PoC projects, Review PRs, or packages for maintenance. 
* I might contribute to private projects, or open sources wherever I feel like it.

My average working hour is 12 hours a day for over 3 years, this is a typical week for me.

If you end up looking at my git or gist you might find something interesting but beware it doesn't fully show my actual knowledge.
